* Usage

First, run =generate-all= to generate a backup of all problem instances.
This takes one hour, mainly because lightsout domain is especially slow to generate.

Then run =copy [fol|propositional] <target directory>= to copy the generated instances to
a target directory. (this avoids accidentally losing your generated instances.)

* Input format

** Propositonal AMA (AMA1,2,3,4)

Propositional AMA models assumes a directory containing two image files named init.png and goal.png.

** Lifted AMA (AMA5)

Lifted AMA models assumes a npz archive as an input.
The archive should contain a field named by "init" and "goal", as well as "picsize".
picsize is an array representing the shape of the rendered image.

Init and goal are arrays containining image patches.
Therefore, if init is an array of shape [5,30,30,3],
this is an environment of 5 objects, each captured in 30x30 bounding box with RGB color.
