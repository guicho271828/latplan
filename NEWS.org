+ *NEWS* Initial release: Published after AAAI18.
+ *NEWS* Updates on version 2: Mainly the refactoring. AAAI18 experiments still works.
+ *NEWS* Updates on version 2.1: Version 2 was not really working and I could finally have time to fix it. Added ZSAE experiments.
+ *NEWS* Updates on version 2.2: Backported more minor improvements from the private repository
+ *NEWS* Updates on version 3.0: Updates for DSAMA system. More refactoring is done on the learner code.
  We newly introduced ama3-planner which takes a PDDL domain file.
+ *NEWS* Updates on version 4.0: Updates for Cube-Space AE in IJCAI2020 paper.
  + This is a version that can exploit the full potential of search heuristics (lower bounds in Branch-and-Bound),
    such as LM-cut or Bisimulation Merge-and-Shrink in Fast Downward.
  + We added the tuned hyperparameters to the repository so that reproducing the experiments will be easy(ish).
  + We now included a script for 15-puzzle instances randomly sampled from the states
    14 or 21 steps away from the goal.
  + We also included a script for Korf's 100 instances of 15-puzzle, but the accuracy
    was not sufficient in those problems where the shortest path length are typically around 50.
    Problems that require deeper searches also require more model accuracy because
    errors accumulate in each state transition.
+ *NEWS* Updates on version 4.1:
  + Improved the installation procedure. Now I recommend =conda= based installation, which specifies the correct Keras + TF versions.
  + The repository is now reorganized so that the library code goes to =latplan= directory and all other scripts remain in the root directory.
    During this migration I used [[https://github.com/newren/git-filter-repo][git-filter-repo]] utility, which rewrites the history.
    This may have broken the older tags --- I will inspect the breakage and fix them soon.
+ *NEWS* Updates on version 4.1.1, 4.1.2: The project is loadable with Anaconda, is pip-installable (somewhat).
+ *NEWS* Updates on version 4.1.3: Minor refactoring. We also released the trained weights. See [[https://github.com/guicho271828/latplan/releases][Releases]].
+ *NEWS* Updates on version 5: Updates for Bidirectional Cube-Space AE in JAIR paper.
  + AMA3+ Cube-Space AE : A revised version of AMA3 Cube-Space AE (IJCAI20 version) which is now modeled as a sound generative model.
  + AMA4+ Bidirectional Cube-Space AE : An extension of Cube-Space AE which can learn both effects and preconditions.
