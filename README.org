* Notes on NVIDIA port of Tensorflow

The system is built on Tensorflow 1.15.
Since the official Tensorflow by Google (both the source code and the package) no longer supports 1.15,
machines with recent GPUs require a [[https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/accelerating-tensorflow-on-a100-gpus/][port maintained by NVIDIA]]. Our installation script installs this port.
*The port only supports Linux, therefore we do not support OSX and Windows.*

* Setup with Anaconda / Miniconda (recommended)

=anaconda= / =miniconda= (https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) is a
dependency management system that can install both python and non-python dependencies into a local, encapsulated environment.
It is conceptually similar to docker, but it does not use virtualization or container infrastructure.
We recommend using =miniconda=, as it is smaller.

After the installation, run the following code:

#+begin_src sh
conda config --add channels conda-forge
conda config --set channel_priority strict
source ./install.sh   # This takes about 15-30 min. Conda does not provide an informative progress, so be patient
#+end_src>


* Command Line Interface

Installing the latest version of Latplan via =pip= creates a runnable =latplan= script in =~/.local/bin=.
The script is not usable for running the experiments (see the next section) because it has an empty hyperparameter.
However, it has the same command line API as =train_common.py=, =train_kltune.py=, and so on,
therefore it may be useful for you to understand the command line API for those scripts.

WARNING:tensorflow:Deprecation warnings have been disabled. Set TF_ENABLE_DEPRECATION_WARNINGS=1 to re-enable them.
WARNING:root:Limited tf.compat.v2.summary API due to missing TensorBoard installation.
Using TensorFlow backend.
Default float: float32
usage: latplan [-h] mode subcommand ...

positional arguments:
  mode     A string which contains mode substrings.
           Recognized modes are:
           
           learn     : perform the training with a hyperparameter tuner. Results are stored in samples/[experiment]/logs/[hyperparameter].
                       If 'learn' is not specified, it attempts to load the stored weights.
           plot      : produce visualizations
           dump      : dump the csv files necessary for producing the PDDL models
           summary   : perform extensive performance evaluations and collect the statistics, store the result in performance.json
           debug     : debug training limited to epoch=2, batch_size=100. dataset is truncated to 200 samples
           reproduce : train the best hyperparameter so far three times with different random seeds. store the best results.
           iterate   : iterate plot/dump/summary commands above over all hyperparmeters that are already trained and stored in logs/ directory.
           
           For example, learn_plot_dump contains 'learn', 'plot', 'dump' mode.
           The separater does not matter because its presense is tested by python's `in` directive, i.e., `if 'learn' in mode:` .
           Therefore, learnplotdump also works.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help    show this help message and exit

subcommand:
  
  A string which matches the name of one of the dataset functions in latplan.main module.
  
  Each task has a different set of parameters, e.g.,
  'puzzle' has 'type', 'width', 'height' where 'type' should be one of 'mnist', 'spider', 'mandrill', 'lenna',
  while 'lightsout' has 'type' being either 'digital' and 'twisted', and 'size' being an integer.
  See subcommand help.

  subcommand
    hanoi       Tower of Hanoi.
    puzzle      Sliding tile puzzle.
    puzzle_objs
                Object-based sliding tile puzzle.
    lightsout   LightsOut game (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lights_Out_(game))
    sokoban     Sokoban environment rendered by PDDLGym.
    sokoban_objs
                Object-based Sokoban environment rendered by PDDLGym.
    blocks      Blocksworld environment.
    blocks_objs
                Object-based blocksworld environment.

* Running

Next, customize the following files for your job scheduler before running.
The job submission commands are stored in a variable =$common=, which by default
has the value like =jbsub -mem 32g -cores 1+1 -queue x86_24h=, which means
the jobs are submitted to a 24 hour runtime limit queue, requesting 1 cpu, 1 gpu (1+1) and 32g memory.
You also need to uncomment the commands to run.
By default, everything is commented out and nothing runs.

#+begin_src sh
# Submit the jobs for training AMA3+ (Cube-Space AEs) and AMA4+ (Bidirectional Cube-Space AEs)
./train_propositional.sh

# Submit the jobs for converting the training results into PDDL files
./pddl-ama3.sh

# Copy the problem instances into a target directory.
problem-generators/copy propositional problem-instances-10min-0.0-1

# Edit run_ama3_all.sh to specify appropriate target directory and then submit the jobs for planning.
# To reproduce the exact same experiments in the paper,
# approximately 400 jobs are submitted. Each job requires 8 cores, no GPUs, and takes 6 hours maximum.
# Details can be customized for your compute environment.
./run_ama3_all.sh 

# After the experiments, run this to generate the tables and figures.
# for details read the source code.
make -C tables
