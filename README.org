* LatPlan : A domain-independent, image-based classical planner

+ *NEWS* Initial release: Published after AAAI18.
+ *NEWS* Updates on version 2: Mainly the refactoring. AAAI18 experiments still works.
+ *NEWS* Updates on version 2.1: Version 2 was not really working and I could finally have time to fix it. Added ZSAE experiments.

[[./install.sh][install.sh]] should install the required libraries on a standard Ubuntu rig.
It requires =sudo= several times. However Python packages are installed in the user directory.

Then run:

#+begin_src sh
./train_all.sh # ~~ few hours

(cd problem-instances; ./example.sh)

# modify run_ama1_all.sh and run_ama2_all.sh for the job scheduler for your compute cluster

./run_ama1_all.sh # MANY hours unless you have a compute cluster
./run_ama2_all.sh # MANY hours unless you have a compute cluster
#+end_src


** Required software

Python 3.5 or later is required.

On Ubuntu, prerequisites can be installed via launching [[./install.sh]] .
The script compiles several C++ and Lisp binaries. However, it does not affect the
running system (e.g. installing a custom software under =/usr/=) except for
performing several =apt-get install= from the official ubuntu repository.

The applications installed by the script consists of:

+ =mercurial g++ cmake make python flex bison g++-multilib= --- these are required for compiling Fast Downward.

+ =git build-essential automake libcurl4-openssl-dev= --- these are required for compiling [Roswell](http://roswell.github.io/). OSX users should use =brew install roswell=.

+ =parallel= --- for running some scripts. This is not essential, but if you don't parallel, give it a try! It is a super useful tool.

+ =python3-pip python3-pil= --- python packages.

+ =tensorflow keras h5py matplotlib progressbar2 timeout_decorator ansicolors scipy scikit-image= --- more python packages.

+ =bash-completion byobu htop mosh= These are not necessary :) but I just use this script also for setting up the environment in a new machine.

** file structure

+ config.py, config_cpu.py :: keras/tensorflow configuration.
+ model.py :: network definitions.
+ strips.py :: (Bad name!) the program for training an SAE,
               and writes the propositional encoding of states/transitions to a CSV file.
+ state_discriminator3.py :: The program for training an SD.
+ action_autoencoder.py :: The program for training an AAE.
+ action_discriminator.py :: The program for training an AD.
+ fd-planner.py :: Latplan using AMA1.
+ trivial-planner.py :: Latplan using AMA2.
+ run_ama1_all.sh, run_ama2_all.sh :: Run all experiments.
+ various sh files :: supporting scripts.
+ util/ :: contains general-purpose utility functions for python code.
+ tests/ :: test files, mostly the unit tests for domain generator/validator
+ samples/ :: where the learned results should go. Each SAE training results are stored in a subdirectory.
+ puzzles/ :: code for domain generators/validators.
  + puzzles/*.py :: each file represents a domain. 
  + puzzles/model/*.py :: the core model (successor rules etc.) of the domain. this is disentangled from the images.
+ problem-instances/ :: where the input problem isntances / experimental results should go.
+ helper/ :: helper scripts for AMA1.
+ (git submodule) planner-scripts/ :: My personal scripts for invoking domain-independent planners.
     Not just Fast Downward.
+ (git submodule) downward/ :: My personally maintained version of Fast Downward, forked around 2015.
